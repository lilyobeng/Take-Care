# Take-Care
Before you can take care of others, you have to take care of yourself first. Unwind the end of your day by reflecting within yourself with the journaling feature; take a moment to explore your emotions, activities & mindfulness to rediscover a new you. Taking care of yourself also means to be kind â€” our daily affirmations will help you take the first step. We all want to be there for our loved one to take care of them & to do that, it starts with you.
